# MuJoCo Integration

Crazyflow focuses on drone dynamics and controllers. However, we still want to provide rendering and collision checking, and to do that we leverage [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) and its JAX port [MJX](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html). We keep an MJX representation of the scene in sync with Crazyflow's dynamics state and invoke MJX functions where needed: collision queries, forward kinematics, and sensor rendering. GUI rendering uses the CPU-side MuJoCo renderer directly.

## MuJoCo and MJX objects

With MJX enabled (the default), Crazyflow maintains two parallel representations:

| Object | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sim.mj_model` | `mujoco.MjModel` | Reference model, used for GUI rendering |
| `sim.mj_data` | `mujoco.MjData` | Scratch MuJoCo data buffer, only used to initialise MJX |
| `sim.mjx_model` | `mjx.Model` | JAX pytree of the model (static, shared across worlds) |
| `sim.mjx_data` | `mjx.Data` | JAX pytree of the scene state, batched over `n_worlds` |

`mjx_data` does not hold the dynamics state. It holds the scene geometry state (body transforms, contact distances, camera positions), derived from `sim.data` through an explicit sync step whenever rendering or collision queries are needed.

## Dynamics-only mode

Large free-flight batches do not need scene geometry. Pass `enable_mjx=False` to avoid constructing
or replicating MuJoCo/MJX data:

<!-- notest: requires a CUDA GPU and intentionally allocates a paper-scale batch -->
```{ .python notest }
from crazyflow.sim import Sim

sim = Sim(n_worlds=1024, n_drones=4096, device="gpu", enable_mjx=False)
sim.step(50)
```

The dynamics and controller pipeline remain fully functional and differentiable. Rendering,
contact queries, raycasting, and MuJoCo model modification require `enable_mjx=True` (the default),
and their public entry points raise `ConfigError` when called in dynamics-only mode. Viewer-marker
helpers remain harmless no-ops until a viewer exists. Disabling MJX is especially important for
large swarms: enabling all drone-to-drone contacts creates a quadratic number of collision
candidates per world.

For rendering or raycasting without collision allocation, keep MJX enabled and disable contacts:

<!-- notest: requires a CUDA GPU and intentionally allocates a large render batch -->
```{ .python notest }
sim = Sim(n_worlds=16, n_drones=1024, device="gpu", enable_contacts=False)
```

Visual geometry remains available, but `sim.contacts()` and collision-geometry configuration raise
`ConfigError`. This render-only mode avoids MJX's quadratic contact buffers, although its batched
kinematics data still scales with `n_worlds * n_drones`.

## MJCF and scene construction

The scene is built programmatically from MJCF (MuJoCo's XML format) at `Sim` construction time using the `MjSpec` API. The process is:

1. Load the base scene from `crazyflow/scene.xml` (floor, lighting, and sky).
2. Load the drone MJCF bundled with `crazyflow.drones` (under `crazyflow/drones`).
3. Mark the drone body as mocap. Mocap bodies are kinematically driven by external position and quaternion updates rather than joints, which avoids the O(nv²) cost of computing constraint matrices and saves memory.
4. Attach one copy per drone to a frame in the world body.
5. Compile the spec into `mj_model`, then convert to `mjx_model` and `mjx_data` via `mjx.put_model` and `mjx.put_data`. Vmap `mjx_data` across `n_worlds`.

The spec is accessible as `sim.spec` before compilation, and `sim.mj_model` / `sim.mjx_model` after.

## Fused drone model (`fused_mjx_model`)

Each drone MJCF defines two bodies. `drone` has separate visual meshes for the PCB, motors, propellers, LEDs, and battery. `drone_fused` bakes the visuals into a single mesh. Passing `fused_mjx_model=True` to `Sim` selects the fused body:

```{ .python }
from crazyflow.sim import Sim

sim = Sim(n_worlds=1, n_drones=1, fused_mjx_model=True)
```

The difference between the two is purely visual. The fused body consists of a single geom with one mesh, which shrinks its memory footprint. The cost is visual detail. Use it for large swarms or headless runs, and keep the default for detailed rendering.

## Adding objects to the scene

Custom geometry (gates, obstacles, walls, or any MJCF body) can be added by editing `sim.spec` and calling `sim.build_mjx()`. The new geometry is available for collision and rendering but has no effect on the drone dynamics, which are computed independently in JAX.

```{ .python }
import mujoco
from crazyflow.sim import Sim

sim = Sim(n_worlds=1, n_drones=1)

# Define a box body as an inline XML string (or load from a file)
box_xml = """
<mujoco>
  <worldbody>
    <body name="obstacle">
      <geom type="box" size="0.1 0.1 0.1" rgba="0.8 0.2 0.2 1"/>
    </body>
  </worldbody>
</mujoco>
"""
obstacle_spec = mujoco.MjSpec.from_string(box_xml)

# Attach one or more instances to a new frame in the scene
frame = sim.spec.worldbody.add_frame()
for i, pos in enumerate([[1.0, 0.0, 0.5], [2.0, 0.0, 0.5]]):
    body = obstacle_spec.body("obstacle")
    attached = frame.attach_body(body, "", f":{i}")
    attached.pos = pos

# Recompile — closes the viewer if open, rebuilds mj_model and mjx_model/mjx_data
sim.build_mjx()
sim.reset()
```

Loading from a file works identically:

<!-- notest: reads external asset assets/gate.xml -->
```{ .python notest }
import mujoco
gate_spec = mujoco.MjSpec.from_file("assets/gate.xml")
```

For a real-world example, see the drone racing environment in [lsy_drone_racing](https://github.com/learnsyslab/lsy_drone_racing), which loads gate and obstacle specs from MJCF files and attaches them at the configured track positions.

### Setting body positions at runtime

If you mark an attached body as mocap (`attached.mocap = True`), its position can be updated at runtime by writing directly into `sim.mjx_data.mocap_pos` without rebuilding the model. This is how the drone positions themselves are driven.

## Synchronization

The JAX dynamics pipeline writes to `sim.data` but never touches `sim.mjx_data`. `mjx_data` is only needed for collision queries and rendering, which require current body transforms. To avoid computing those on every dynamics step, Crazyflow tracks `mjx_synced` (poses/cameras) and `mjx_collision_synced` flags in `sim.data.core`.

After `sim.step()` or `sim.reset()`, both flags are set to `False`. Rendering and contact methods synchronize the data they require. Pose-only synchronization keeps `mjx_collision_synced=False`, so a later contact query cannot accidentally consume stale collision results.

`sync_sim2mjx` does three things:

1. Write drone positions and quaternions into `mjx_data.mocap_pos` / `mjx_data.mocap_quat`.
2. `jax.vmap(mjx.kinematics)` to propagate body transforms through the kinematic tree.
3. `jax.vmap(mjx.camlight)` and `jax.vmap(mjx.collision)` for rendering and contact detection respectively.

These run only once per render or contact call, regardless of how many dynamics steps were taken since the last sync.

<!-- notest: requires rendering -->
```{ .python notest }
for i in range(10):
    sim.step(5)                       # JAX dynamics only, mjx_synced = False
    if i % 5 == 0:
        sim.render(mode="rgb_array")  # syncs once: kinematics + camlight + collision
```

## Advanced: the sync flag and avoiding redundant MJX calls

By default, `sync_sim2mjx` runs kinematics, collision detection, and camera transforms in one shot.
The two sync flags avoid redundant work while distinguishing pose-only results from collision-ready
results. Both flags are cleared when dynamics state changes.

This means the order of calls matters. Grouping all rendering and contact queries together after a step lets them share a single sync:

<!-- notest: requires rendering -->
```{ .python notest }
sim.step(5)
contacts = sim.contacts()     # sync runs here
sim.render(mode="rgb_array")  # flag already set, no second sync
```

Interleaving a step between them forces two syncs:

<!-- notest: requires rendering -->
```{ .python notest }
contacts = sim.contacts()     # sync runs here
sim.step(5)                   # flag cleared
sim.render(mode="rgb_array")  # sync runs again
```

## Advanced: fusing mjx_data into a contact check function

Passing `sim.mjx_data` as an argument to a `@jax.jit`-compiled function is expensive. JAX must flatten the entire pytree at the JIT boundary on every call, and `mjx_data` contains many leaves. For contact checking that runs in a tight loop, this overhead matters.

The solution is to **close over** `mjx_data` rather than pass it as an argument. With `mjx_data` captured in the function closure, JAX treats it as a constant and only flattens it once at compile time. At call time, only the small dynamic state needs to be canonicalized.

The drone racing environment in [lsy_drone_racing](https://github.com/learnsyslab/lsy_drone_racing) uses this pattern to build a contact check function:

```python
from jax import Array

from crazyflow.sim import Sim
from crazyflow.sim.sim import sync_sim2mjx
from crazyflow.sim.data import SimData

sim = Sim(n_worlds=1, n_drones=1)
sim.reset()

_mjx_data = sim.mjx_data  # captured in closure


def check_contacts(sim_data: SimData, obstacle_mocap_pos: Array) -> Array:
    # Update obstacle positions and sync inside JIT
    mjx_data = _mjx_data.replace(mocap_pos=obstacle_mocap_pos)
    _, mjx_data = sync_sim2mjx(sim_data, mjx_data, sim.mjx_model)
    return mjx_data._impl.contact.dist < 0


in_contact = check_contacts(sim.data, sim.mjx_data.mocap_pos)
```

`_mjx_data` is fused into the closure and compiled as a constant. Only `sim_data` and the obstacle positions cross the JIT boundary at runtime — a much smaller pytree than passing the full `mjx_data`.
